# PostScript Printer Application

This repository contains a Printer Application for PostScript printers
that uses [PAPPL](https://www.msweet.org/pappl) to support IPP
printing from multiple operating systems. In addition, it uses the resources
of [cups-filters 2.x](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters) (filter
functions in libcupsfilters, libppd). This work is derived from the
[hp-printer-app](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/hp-printer-app).

Your contributions are welcome. Please post [issues and pull
requests](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ps-printer-app).

This Printer Application is a working model for

- A non-raster Printer Application: Destination format is PostScript,
  a high-level/vector format. Input data in PostScript or PDF is
  accepted and needed conversion is done without any inbetween raster
  steps.

- A Printer Application which uses the new filter functions of
  cups-filters 2.x. Filter functions are library functions derived
  from cups-filters and contain decades of development and refinement
  starting from the introduction of CUPS in 2000.

- A retro-fit Printer Application for classic CUPS drivers, in this
  case the simplest form of only PPD files for PostScript printers. It
  lists PPD files from repositories included in the Snap, loads the
  PPD needed for the actual printer, extracts options from the PPD to
  display them in the web interface, accepts job settings as IPP
  attributes, and inserts the PostScript code provided by the PPD
  correctly into the output data stream.

- A Printer Application which does not pass through raw (input format
  is printer's native format) jobs. To assure that always the
  PostScript code of the PPD file is inserted into the output stream,
  we call the printer's native format
  "application/vnd.printer-specific" which does not exist as input
  format, so "application/postscript" input is forced through the
  pstops() filter function.

- To avoid the need to re-invent the code for forking into sub-processes
  so that we can pass data through a sequence of filters, we create a
  filter function to send the data off to the printer and form a chain
  of the actually converting filter function (one of pstops() and
  pdftops()) with this filter function using the filterChain() filter
  function.

- For PWG/Apple Raster input we use raster callbacks so that the
  processing is streaming, allowing for large and even infinitely long
  jobs. We use libppd functions to insert the PPD option's PostScript
  code in the output stream and the filterPOpen() function to create a
  file descriptor for the libppd functions to send data off to the
  device.

- The PostScript Printer Application Snap has all PostScript PPD files
  of the [foomatic-db](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/foomatic-db)
  and [HPLIP](https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing)
  projects built-in, so most PostScript printer PPDs which usually
  come with Linux Distributions. Note that some PPDs use certain CUPS
  filters for extra functionality. These filters are not included. The
  user can add additional PPDs without needing to rebuild the Snap.

- We use the printer's IEEE-1284 device ID to identify at first that
  it is a PostScript printer (via CMD: field) to see whether it is
  supported at all and only then check via make and model whether we
  explicitly support it with a PPD. PostScript printers for which
  there is no PPD get a generic PPD assigned. By the check of the CMD:
  field before make/model lookup we assure that if PostScript is
  provided by an add-on module that the module is actually installed.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- This Printer Application and its snapping is derived from the
  hp-printer-app, which uses the "avahi-observe" Snap interface to
  access DNS-SD. This does not work for registering printers. In this
  Printer Application this is already corrected to "avahi-control".


## TODO:

- Automatic start of the Printer Application as a daemon

- Add printer auto-setup for all supported printers

- Correct locations for the state file, the log file, and user-added
  PPD files

- Add PPD files via web interface

- Build options for cups-filters, to build without libqpdf and/or
  withour libppd, the former will allow to create the Snap of this
  Printer Application without downloading and building QPDF

- Better way to download HPLIP for grabbing the PostScript PPD files
  for HP printers

- Use [pyppd](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/pyppd) to compress the
  built-in PPD repositories

- In `ps-printer-app.c` many places are marked with `XXX`. These are
  points to be improved.


## BUILDING AND INSTALLING

NOTE: There is a bug in Ubuntu Groovy (20.10) that prevents it from
building Snaps, see [this discussion on the Snapcraft
forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/build-fails-with-a-mksquashfs-error-cannot-pack-root-prime/). The
problem is already solved but did not make it into Groovy yet.

Any older Ubuntu version (like 20.04) should work.

In the main directory of this repository run

```
snapcraft snap
```

This will download all needed packages and build the PostScript
Printer Application. Note that PAPPL (upcoming 1.0) and cups-filters
(upcoming 2.0) are pulled directly from their GIT repositories, as
there are no appropriate releases yet. This can also lead to the fact
that this Printer Application will suddenly not build any more.

To install the resulting Snap run

```
sudo snap install --dangerous ps-printer-app_1.0_amd64.snap
```

Then connect the interfaces:

```
sudo snap connect ps-printer-app:avahi-control
sudo snap connect ps-printer-app:log-observe
sudo snap connect ps-printer-app:network-manager
sudo snap connect ps-printer-app:raw-usb
```

Now fire up the Printer Application as a server daemon:

```
ps-printer-app server
```

Enter the web interface

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

Use the web interface to add a printer. Supply a name, select the
discovered printer, then select make and model. Also set the loaded
media and the option defaults.

Then print PDF, PostScript, JPEG, Apple Raster, or PWG Raster files
with

```
ps-printer-app FILE
```

You can also add PPD files without rebuilding the Snap. Do

```
sudo cp PPDFILE /var/snap/ps-printer-app/common/ppd/
```

`PPDFILE` cannot only be a single PPD file but any number of single
PPD files, `.tar.gz` files containing PPDs (in arbitrary directory
structure) and PPD-gemerating executables which are usually put into
`/usr/lib/cups/driver`. You can also create arbitrary sub-directory
structures in `/var/snap/ps-printer-app/current/` containing the
mentioned types of files. Only make sure to not put any executables
there which do something else than listing and generating PPD files.

If you have a `ps-printer-app` server running you have to restart it
to get your added PPD files visible in the list when adding a printer.

See

```
ps-printer-app --help
```

for more options, use the "--debug" info for verbose logging in your
terminal window.

You can also do a "quick-and-dirty" build wothout snapping. You need a
directory with the latest GIT snapshot of PAPPL and the latest GIT
snapshot of cups-filters (master branch). Both PAPPL and cups-filters
need to be compiled (./cnfigure; make), installing not needed. Also
install the header files of all needed libraries (installing
"libcups2-dev" should do it).

In the directory with the attached ps-printer-app.c run the command
line

```
gcc -o ps-printer-app ps-printer-app.c $PAPPL_SRC/pappl/libpappl.a $CUPS_FILTERS_SRC/.libs/libppd.a $CUPS_FILTERS_SRC/.libs/libcupsfilters.a -ldl -lpthread  -lppd -lcups -lavahi-common -lavahi-client -lgnutls -ljpeg -lpng16 -ltiff -lz -lm -lusb-1.0 -lpam -lqpdf -lstdc++ -I. -I$PAPPL_SRC/pappl -I$CUPS_FILTERS_SRC/ppd -I$CUPS_FILTERS_SRC/cupsfilters
```

Then run

```
./ps-printer-app --help
```

When running the non-snapped version, by default, PPD files are
searched for in

```
/usr/share/ppd/
/usr/lib/cups/driver/
```

You can set the `PPD_PATHS` environment variable to search other
places instead:

```
PPD_PATHS=/path/to/my/ppds:/my/second/place ./ps-printer-app server
```

Simply put a colon-separated list of any amount of paths into the
variable. Creating a wrapper script is recommended.

For access to the test page `testpage.ps` use the TESTPAGE_DIR
environment variable:

```
TESTPAGE_DIR=`pwd` PPD_PATHS=/path/to/my/ppds:/my/second/place ./ps-printer-app server
```

or for your own creation of a test page (PostScript, PDF, PNG, JPEG,
Apple Raster, PWG Raster):

```
TESTPAGE=/path/to/my/testpage/my_testpage.ps PPD_PATHS=/path/to/my/ppds:/my/second/place ./ps-printer-app server
```
